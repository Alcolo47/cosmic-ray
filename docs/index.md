# Cosmic Ray: mutation testing for Python

*"Four human beings -- changed by space-born cosmic rays into something more than merely human."*
*â€” The Fantastic Four*

Cosmic Ray is a tool for performing mutation testing on Python
code.

## N.B.! Cosmic Ray is still learning how to walk!

At this time Cosmic Ray is young and incomplete. It doesn't support
all of the mutations it should, its output format is crude, it only
supports some forms of test discovery, it may fall over on exotic
modules...[the list goes on and on](https://github.com/sixty-north/cosmic-ray/issues). Still,
for the adventurous it *does* work. Hopefully things will improve
fairly rapidly.

And, of course, patches and ideas are welcome.
