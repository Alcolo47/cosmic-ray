  How can workers use the new config system? Can we just serialize the config
  and send it in that way? We wold probably want two modes: one where we send in
  the config as a string and another where the worker reads a config file (so
  that it's easy to run the worker manually).
** TODO Workers should accept a config file on the command line
   They'll take the config file along with the parameters telling them what mutation to run.
   This will make it easier to run workers locally/manually when necessary.
** TODO Workers should be able to read their config via stdin
   This is how they'll get config under normal operation.
* No-local-import
  This should probably be part of the config file. Does it only apply to
  workers? Or does it apply to baseline as well?
